# CDC (Change Data Capture) with Kafka Connect

## Overview
Change Data Capture (CDC) with Kafka Connect allows you to capture and stream changes happening in your databases to Apache Kafka topics. This enables real-time data integration, stream processing, and analytics.

## Prerequisites
- Apache Kafka and Kafka Connect installed and running
- Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB) set up and accessible from Kafka Connect

## Setup Steps

### Step 1: Install Kafka Connect JDBC Sink Connector
- Download and install the Kafka Connect JDBC Sink Connector for your database. This allows Kafka Connect to capture database changes and publish them to Kafka topics.

### Step 2: Configure the JDBC Sink Connector
- Configure the JDBC Sink Connector properties to connect to your database and define the topic mappings for capturing changes.

### Step 3: Start Kafka Connect
- Start the Kafka Connect service and ensure that the JDBC Sink Connector is properly configured and running.

### Step 4: Monitor and Validate
- Monitor the Kafka Connect logs to ensure that the JDBC Sink Connector is successfully capturing and publishing database changes to Kafka topics.
- Validate that the messages are being published to the specified Kafka topics.

## Example Configuration (MySQL)
```properties
name=my-jdbc-sink-connector
connector.class=io.confluent.connect.jdbc.JdbcSinkConnector
tasks.max=1
topics=my_table
connection.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
connection.user=user
connection.password=password
auto.create=true
insert.mode=upsert
pk.mode=record_key
pk.fields=id
```

## Conclusion
By setting up CDC with Kafka Connect, you can efficiently capture changes in your databases and stream them to Kafka for real-time processing, analytics, and integration with downstream systems.

For detailed configuration and connector-specific settings, refer to the official documentation and user guides for the specific JDBC Sink Connector and your database type.
